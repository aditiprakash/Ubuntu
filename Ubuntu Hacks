USEFUL HACKS:

1. VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Create virtual environments when your projects require a different version of Python. Ubuntu by default comes with a python 2.7. With Anaconda, you can set up Python 3 for the system. Different projects might require different versions of python for various reasons. Use Virtual environments to enable this.

Command:
// Create and activate virtual environment
$ conda create -n <name_of_venv> python=<specify_version_of_python>
$ source activate  <name_of_venv>

// Deactivate i.e exit out of the environent and delete the virtual environment
$ source deactivate <name_of_venv>
$ conda env remove --name <name_of_venv>

// Lists available virtual environments
$ conda info --envs


2. History of terminal

Get history of commands used in terminal. Navigate to file explorer, Ctrl+h to list hidden files. Go to .bash_history file.

3. Wi-Fi Problems

Ubuntu often has wi-fi cnnectivity problems which can be resolved by typing the following command in the terminal.

$ sudo service network-manager restart
